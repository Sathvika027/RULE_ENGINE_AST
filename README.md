## RULE ENGINE WITH AST


## Overview

This application is a rule engine that determines user eligibility based on attributes such as age, department, salary, and experience. It uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent and manage conditional rules, allowing for dynamic rule creation, combination, and evaluation.
